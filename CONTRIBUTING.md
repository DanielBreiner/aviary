## How to contribute to Aviary

#### **Did you find a bug?**

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/DanielBreiner/aviary/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

- Ensure the PR description includes the relevant issue number and describes the solution.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

- Open an issue on GitHub, with a proposal of your change. Do not start working on the code until the proposal is accepted. We will discuss this proposal and its implementation, only after accepting it a PR can be opened.

Thank you!
